      year: 1957,
      history: "Helvetica was born in 1957 in Switzerland, a country that was becoming a center of modern graphic design after World War II. The typeface was originally named Neue Haas Grotesk and was designed by Max Miedinger, with direction from Eduard Hoffmann, at the Haas Type Foundry in Münchenstein. The goal was not artistic expression or personality. It was clarity. Hoffmann wanted a neutral, modern sans-serif typeface that could compete with existing grotesk fonts and work well in advertising, signage, and corporate communication.",
